# SoME Book List

## About
Display CSV list of books from the Southern Maine Men's Book club in a searchable, filterable, pretty HTML table. Done in 100% JavaScript. Originally forked from [derekeder/csv-to-html-table](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table), but later
converted to just using JSON data and jQuery DataTables directly.

Using Amazon images as per [How to get book cover image url using ISBN](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33886418/how-to-get-book-cover-image-url-using-isbn) on StackOverflow.

## Usage

In typical usage the `some-books.json` is updated with new books we have read or are reading. Then, viola, the site is magically and deliciously updated.

## Changing the Code 

Originally adapted from [derekeder/csv-to-html-table](https://github.com/derekeder/csv-to-html-table). I no longer use any
of Derek's code.
